  Audacity: A Digital Audio Editor

  Experimental.cmake

  Used at configuration time to generate compiler options that enable or disable
  experimental features.

  When the features become mainstream the options will then be retired.

  JKC: This file solves a problem of how to avoid forking the
  code base when working on new features e.g:
    - Additional displays in Audacity
    - Modular architecture.
  Add options in here for the new features, and make your code
  conditional on them with #ifdef.

  For each name in the list, EXPERIMENTAL_{name} is the token to test with
  #ifdef.

  All the options are positive, i.e., when not commented out,
  they enable the feature.
